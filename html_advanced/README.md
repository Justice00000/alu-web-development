### HTML_ADVANCED
In this project, I implemented from scratch a webpage from a designer file.
The focus was on the structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantics.

### General Requirements
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- You are not allowed to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript.No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator
